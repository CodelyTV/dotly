## Roadmap

If you want to contribute you can, here I have some ideas. Some are a WIP and I am developing some of them. The cross for a task done, mean that it is merged in master.

- [ ] Documentation for core libraries as API reference.
- [ ] Documentation how to do a script
- [ ] **Script creation from template (this is done and I will merge it soon).**
- [ ] *Install on WSL from a Powershell Script (I am Working on this, right now).*
- [ ] **Automatic Updates (it is done and I will merge it soon through PR).**
- [ ] **Separate .bashrc and .zshrc and dotly loading (it is done and I will merge it soon). This makes easier to update any core features.**
- [ ] Scripts Marketplace (Almost done in feature/marketplace)
- [ ] **Create your dotfiles in iCloud and restore from it (this is done and I will merge it soon).**
- [ ] **Improve receipes to add receipes for custom dotfiles (not in core) and installation check for packages with no the same name as a binary.**
- [ ] Posix compatibility for all scripts and libraries (maybe not necessary but needs at least, a review).
- [ ] Improve error handling in all scripts and libraries (maybe not necessary but needs at least, a review).
- [ ] **Move files to inside your dotfiles from shell and add it to `symlinks/conf.yaml` file automatically (almost done).**
- [ ] **Managing secrets (almost done). Needs a refactor and some fixes.**

It is important to keep compatibility with dotly scripts.
